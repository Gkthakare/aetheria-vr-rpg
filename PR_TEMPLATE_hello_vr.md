# PR: Hello VR - Unity Project Scaffold

## Summary
This PR establishes the foundational Unity project structure for Aetheria VR RPG with basic VR functionality. It includes a Hello VR scene setup, VR player controller, and comprehensive testing framework.

## Files Changed
- `unity-project/.gitignore` - Unity-specific gitignore rules
- `unity-project/Assets/Scripts/VRPlayerController.cs` - Basic VR controller with teleportation
- `unity-project/Assets/Tests/HelloTests.cs` - Unit tests for VR functionality
- `unity-project/Assets/Scenes/HelloVR_SetupInstructions.md` - Detailed scene setup guide
- `unity-project/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` - Unity 2022.3 LTS project version
- `README.md` - Updated with comprehensive setup and build instructions

## How to Test Locally

### Unity Editor Testing
1. Open Unity 2022.3 LTS or later
2. Open the `unity-project` folder as a Unity project
3. Follow `Assets/Scenes/HelloVR_SetupInstructions.md` to create the HelloVR scene
4. Run Unity Test Runner (Window > General > Test Runner > PlayMode tab > Run All)
5. Press Play in the scene to test VR functionality

### Quest 3 Testing
1. Configure XR settings (Window > XR Plug-in Management > OpenXR)
2. Build for Android (File > Build Settings > Android)
3. Install on Quest 3:
   ```bash
   adb install aetheria-hello-vr.apk
   adb shell am start -n com.yourcompany.aetheria/.UnityPlayerActivity
   ```
4. Test VR controls: head movement, controller triggers for teleportation

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [x] Unity project structure created with proper folder hierarchy
- [x] VRPlayerController script with teleportation functionality
- [x] Unit tests covering basic VR controller functionality
- [x] Comprehensive setup documentation
- [x] Build instructions for Quest 3
- [x] Git configuration with proper .gitignore
- [x] Clear commit message following project conventions

## Technical Details

### VRPlayerController Features
- OpenXR-compatible controller input handling
- Teleportation movement system
- Debug logging for development
- Public API for position/rotation queries

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for component initialization
- PlayMode tests for scene loading
- Manual testing procedures for Quest 3

### Design Decisions
- **OpenXR over legacy XR**: Future-proof choice for Quest 3 compatibility
- **Action-based input**: More flexible than legacy input system
- **Teleportation over smooth locomotion**: Reduces motion sickness in VR
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Beginner-friendly setup instructions

## Next Recommended Task
**Chunked World Generation** - Implement deterministic chunk generator with seeded Perlin noise for infinite world generation.
